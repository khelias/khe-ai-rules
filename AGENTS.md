# Personal AGENTS.md

Personal instructions for AI coding agents, scoped to the KHE umbrella.
Auto-loaded by:

- OpenAI Codex CLI (via `<KHE_ROOT>/AGENTS.md`, symlinked to this file)
- Claude Code (via `<KHE_ROOT>/CLAUDE.md` which `@`-imports this file)
- Cursor, Aider, Copilot, and 20+ other AGENTS.md-aware tools, when run with cwd at `<KHE_ROOT>`

This file holds **personal preferences** that apply to every project
under the KHE umbrella. Other projects on the same machine are not
affected by this file - their own `~/.claude/` or per-project setup
applies instead. For KHE-project-specific instructions, use a
per-project `AGENTS.md`.

Keep this file under 200 lines. It's loaded into every session, so size costs tokens forever.

## Communication

- Conversation language: Estonian (primary working language).
- Code, identifiers, in-code comments: English (industry convention, portability).
- User-facing translations and localization: Estonian, grammatically correct. No machine-translated approximations. If unsure, ask.
- Match response weight to question weight. Routine work gets terse output. Architectural or decision-heavy work gets the reasoning trail. The user works with the agent partly to learn, not just to receive magic results.
- Avoid AI-tells that signal machine-generated output:
  - No emoji.
  - No em-dashes. Use a regular hyphen, comma, or rephrase.
  - No bloated openings ("Great question!", "Certainly!", "I'll help you with that").
  - No bloated closings ("Let me know if you need anything else", "Hope this helps").
  - No unnecessary headers, tables, or bullet lists on simple answers. Match formatting to content weight.

## Code style

- All code, identifiers, file names, in-code comments: English.
- Estonian appears only in user-facing strings, i18n and translation tables (grammatically correct), and conversation with the user.
- Comments inside code: only when the WHY is non-obvious (covered in Boundaries below).

## Documentation

- Trivial changes (typos, small internal refactors) do not need README or doc updates. Adding docs for every change adds noise.
- However, no module should be completely undocumented. If you touch a feature that has no doc string or no README mention, add a one-line summary while you're there.
- When uncertain whether something needs documenting, ASK before adding.

This is a judgment call, not a hard rule.

## Maintaining project AGENTS.md

When a structural change lands in a project (deps bump that touches a
named library, refactor that moves files, new architectural decision,
build/test/deploy command change, new HARD invariant), update that
project's `AGENTS.md` in the SAME commit. AGENTS.md should reflect
current reality, not historical reality.

Prefer descriptive facts over prohibitions. "Tailwind v3 currently"
beats "DO NOT use v4" - the prohibition becomes silently wrong on the
day v4 lands. Architectural prohibitions stay (security, invariants),
but couple them with an override path ("without an ADR") so the rule
is not a permanent lock.

The `audit-agents-md` skill (loaded from `<KHE_ROOT>/.claude/skills/`)
can be invoked on demand to check whether a project's AGENTS.md drifted
from reality.

## Verification

The agent MUST verify changes before declaring done:

- Run the project's test command
- Run the project's typecheck/lint command
- For UI changes, verify in a running browser if a dev server is available
- Report verification results explicitly, both successes and failures

If verification can't be performed in this environment, say so. Do not claim success.

## Boundaries

### Always

- Read existing code before editing
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Verify changes before declaring done

### Ask first

- Destructive operations (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, dropping tables, force-push)
- Rewriting published commits
- Adding new dependencies
- Changes to CI/CD pipelines

### Never

- Skip git hooks (`--no-verify`)
- Commit secrets, `.env` files, credentials
- Add unrequested documentation files (READMEs, CHANGELOGs)
- Add comments explaining WHAT code does. Only WHY when non-obvious.

## File hygiene

- Don't leave half-finished code or commented-out blocks
- Don't add features beyond the task scope
- Don't introduce abstractions for hypothetical future needs

## What goes elsewhere

- **Project-specific commands and architecture** → that project's `AGENTS.md`
- **Tech-stack patterns** (TypeScript, Playwright, etc.) → `shared/*.md`, copied into project AGENTS.md
- **Workflow recipes** (TDD loop, verification, commit style) → `skills/*.md`
- **Specialized review/planning tasks** → `agents/*.md` (delegate via subagent)
- **Claude Code hook scripts** → `hooks/*.{sh,js}`
- **Claude-specific imports/extensions** → `CLAUDE.md`
